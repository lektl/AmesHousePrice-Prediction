### Overview

Using the Ames housing data, the goal of this project is to create a regression model that is able to accurately predict the sale price of each house in Ames, given a set of features. The evaluation of this project will be done through a Kaggle submission, with leaderboard standings determined by the root mean squared error (RMSE) of your predicted house sale price vs. the actual house sale price. 

### Problem Statement

For our business model as a start-up, we are aiming to set up a Sale Price recommendation tool where users can use to get a recommended Sale Price with just a few details about their property for sale. This webpage would have specific fields for users to fill property details and submit. Using the underlying regression model, the web application will generate a quote estimate for their property Sale Price. The webpage url can be found below.

### Executive Summary

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses. The dataset contains information from the Ames Assessorâ€™s Office used in computing assessed values for individual residential properties sold in Ames, IA from 2006 to 2010.

In this project, I performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis to understand linear relationships among the most important variables and detect potential issues such as sknewness, outliers and missing values. Then, I handled these issues by cleaning the data and performed feature engineering. Lastly, I built regression models to predict the house prices.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

From the EDA, we can see that the factors that affect house price the most are likely to be quality (e.g. overall_qual) and area (e.g. gr_liv_area, total_bsmt_sf, garage_area). , based on the relationship with saleprice revealed in the correlation heatmap and scatterplots.

Limitations:

- Although my model seems to do well, it might not be able to come up with accurate predictions for properties above $400k due to the right-skewed distribution of Sale Price.
- Features with good predictive value for Sale Price tend to have high multicollinearity with each other.
- This model does not take into account any economic or external factors that may affect Sale Price: for example, housing loan interest rates, unemployment figures, inflation, natural disasters etc.

Recommendations:

- Collect more recent data (newer than 2010).
- Collect more data points with house saleprices above $400k.
- Get access to Sale Condition feature.
- Collect data on other features not in current data that may have influence on house saleprice (e.g. Transportation facilities nearby).
